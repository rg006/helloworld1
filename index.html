                    <strong>How it works:</strong>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Create a parent account by signing in!</li>
                        <li>Add a child account using the "Add Child" function.</li>
                        <li>Make sure you've added the child before letting them sign in to the site using the email
                            you
                            used to add them.</li>
                    </ol>
                    As a parent, you can create tasks, which will reward your child(ren) with coins. You can also
                    add
                    prizes,
                    where your child(ren) will be able to purchase the prizes you've uploaded for coins earned through tasks.<br><br>
                    As a child, you can earn coins by completing tasks and purchase prizes from your parent.
