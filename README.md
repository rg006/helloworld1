## Inspiration
We have noticed a lot of the young children in our community were so accustomed to effortless transactions through cards or applications, they didn’t have an understanding of the need to earn money to be able to spend it. So, we decided to create a web application that helps parents teach their young kids the important concept of earning money, rather than it being a given.

## What it does
FINANCEBUD! Is a web application that allows parents to create different tasks for their children to complete in exchange for prizes. FINANCEBUD! Allows kids to complete the tasks set by their parents in return for some ‘money’. They can then exchange that ‘money’ in return for some prizes. This would engage the young minds and help them better understand that money needs to be earned before being readily available, as well as the different costs of the things they might buy.

## How we built it
HTML, JS, CSS, Firebase

## Challenges we ran into
We had some trouble with making sure all the files were linked together properly and functional. And making sure that the project looked inviting and fun for young children, while at the same time being clearly readable.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud to have overcome the difficulties and challenges faced while working on this and coding with a language we are unfamiliar with.

## What we learned
We have a better understanding of what goes into even the simplest of applications or features we use on the web. As well as how to tailor our language, font, and style to suit a significantly younger audience, while at the same time being ‘adult-friendly’ as well. 


## What's next for FINANCEBUD!
Upnext, we want build on this basic application even more, by enhancing its interface currently and maybe adding a new feature to allow children to invest the ‘money’ they earn from tasks. By adding the feature to allow investing, children can get a basic understanding of stocks, and investment as well.
